# Notice to TOR/advanced users

This website uses Javascript to load the headers and footers across all pages. If you have Javascript disabled (which is fine!) then the header/footer won't work. I am working on including a sitemap so you can move around the website without Javascript. Apologies for any inconvinience. 

Please keep in mind that this is hosted using Github Pages. I don't know if Github collects data/analytics about users that visit their websites. I'm going to hope they don't, but if you are super paranoid, you can stop using this website if you haven't already. 

# Credits

Credit for the header and footer goes to [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reusable-html-components-how-to-reuse-a-header-and-footer-on-a-website/). 

Thanks to [W3](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/fonts.en.html) for font inspiration. I never knew that DejaVu Sans Mono was a font!
